# Imagin!

## The world
Close your eyes and envision the future world around you. How does the earth feel? How does the air smell? How does the ocean sound? How do plants taste? How do animals look?

## Our goal
Build a retreat center for young people in Apuseni, Carpathian mountains:
- a safe place away from educational-economic-cultural system and its pressure
- a sapce to explore true purpose

## In practice
Invite people into the forest, clean it up, then light a fire, make a circle of youth and elders to inspire, role model and guide through the journey of life.
