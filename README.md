## Composition vs. MVVM
Recent years have seen huge popularity in Composition frameworks. At the same time MVVM frameworks have been declining.

## Our goal
Our goal is to create an unoppinionated library that is 100% declarative and helps with reusability as well as separation of concerns. It is compatible with all third party Web Components.

## In practice
We think that a full blown application, loaded with business logic, needs both Composition and a horizontal architecture as found in (for instance) MVVM.
