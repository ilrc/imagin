<img src="images/dhyan-l.jpg" alt="Dhyan Or, Co-Founder of the All Nations Cafe, at Ein Haniya spring, &copy; photo by Simona Or-Munteanu" >
    <h2>Dhyan Or</h2>
    <p>Born in Jerusalem, to new immigrant Jews from the Soviet Union, Dhyan grew up with kids whose families came from Morocco, Iran and Iraq. He later travelled in the Middle East, the Far East and Europe, connecting with extra-ordinary people who lead simple lives according to ancient wisdom. A connection with a unique Palestinian man brought him back to Jerusalem, where he discovered a whole quarter of his childhood city which had always been hidden from his eyes. It was in this place, on the Mount of Olives, where he was inspired by the spirit of hospitality and caring of his host, together with loving and supporting friends, to realize the dream of the All Nations Caf&eacute;.</p>
    <br><br>

     <h2><img src="images/abed.jpg" alt="Abed at Ein Haniya, &copy; photo by Dhyan Or" ></h2>
     <h2>Abed Abd Raba</h2>
     <p>A son of farmers from Walaja village, south of Jerusalem, Abed was born in Dheishe refugee camp near Bethlehem. Embodying the Palestinian spirit of freedom and peace, he is first and foremost a man of the land. A <i>falah</i> who cultivates his plants with such care, love and connection with the earth, that even the soldiers who try to drive him away from his ancestral land are compelled to honor.</p>
      <br><br>

    <img src="images/lisa-b.jpg" alt="Lisa at Ein Haniya, &copy; photo by Itsik" >

While heading a news company, running day camps for Palestinian kids and supporting All Nations Caf&eacute; projects, she can introduce the Circassian spirit in a way that inspires people to dance with the grace and self esteem of princes and princesses.</p>
    <br><br>
        
	<h2><img src="images/daphna-b.jpg" alt="Daphna at Ein Haniya, &copy; photo by Dhyan Or" ></h2>
     <h2>Daphna Rosenberg    </h2> 
	 <p>Daphna is a gifted singer and musician, dedicated to opening hearts and connecting people to each other and to God, through her music. After years of traveling and singing through many places around the world, she is now committed to living in Israel and singing around the Middle East, where the work is desperately needed. Daphna has helped set up many of the All Nations Cafe caravans, gatherings and camps and brought the spirit of song and dance into them. Her intention is to expand her work by introducing the Dances of Universal Peace.</p>
     <br><br>
	  
	   <h2><img src="images/miriam-s.jpg" alt="Miriam at Ein Haniya, &copy; photo by Dhyan Or" ></h2>

Whether our circle numbers five or a hundred people, Jeff always manages to lead us into a healing and blessing space, teaching us to sense our individual and group energies, focus and use them to make a tangible positive change.</p>
	<br><br>

     <h2><img src="images/ibrahim-s.jpg" alt="Ibrahim at Nabi Musa, &copy; photo by Eitan" width="176" height="191" /></h2>
     <h2>Ibrahim Abu el Hawa     </h2>
     <p>The man behind it all. Ibrahim is a descendant of a line of farmers who have been living on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem for more than a thousand years. He is a symbol of hospitality and generosity, and his home is famous around the world as a place of rest and nourishment to body and soul. It is in this home that the first All Nations Cafe project was inspired and conceived, and where the first meetings and gatherings took place among mountains of delicious home made Middle Eastern food.</p>

      <p>Even though he retired from his occupation as an ophthalmologist, David is fully committed to fixing people's sight so it can accept the vision of peace through brotherhood. His attraction to the orient has pulled him from various places in Europe, mainly the UK and Germany, to the Middle East, where he is known as King David of Arabia, and admired by Palestinians, Jordanians and Israelis, who all see him as a close benevolent relative and a relentless believer in the good nature of man. </p>
